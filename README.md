# Crusty Media Player
This Media Player was built to be able to take Multi-Track Video Files  (ex: If you clip Recordings with separate Audio Tracks like System Audio and Microphone Audio) and give you the ability to play them back with both tracks synced without the use of an external editing software like Premiere Pro!

**Crusty_Media_Player.py is the locally run version of the code wheras Crusty_Media_Player_Pkg.py is the version with file path specifications for the setup.exe**

# SETUP

3. Follow setup prompts.

**Optional**
4. Go to settings -> Apps -> Default Apps
