# Crusty-Media-Player
This Media Player was built to be able to take Multi-Track Video Files  (ex: If you clip Recordings with separate Audio Tracks like System Audio and Microphone Audio) and give you the ability to play them back with both tracks synced without the use of an external editing software like Premiere Pro!
